Since joining the Trunk Club Engineering team in early October, 2013, I've traversed the design and engineering gamut ranging from product discovery / design to application development. Though business needs required my role to be a bit of a generalist at times, my focus for most projects is on product / interface design and UI engineering for web and iOS applications. These projects span a period ranging from a small tech team within a sole Chicago headquarters to working with dozens of world class engineers for [offices across the nation][link3] (not to mention [being acquired][link2]).

My first area of work revolved around the member experience. I spent some time getting my feet wet in the codebase by developing features and fixing bugs for [trunkclub.com][link4]. After this I was part of a small team designing and developing the UI and experience for a business changing feature that allowed members to review a trunk before it was physically shipped (electing to send or not send each item, with feedback for each).

After this I switched my focus to internal applications that help the business run more efficiently. Part of this was designing and developing interface features for an application used by employees to digitally shop our inventory for members. Unlike a typical e-commerce experience, this allows the shopping experience to be completely centralized to the member at hand, providing a simpler playing field for more peresonalized choices.

A key feature I worked on that allowed for an improved member experience downstream was the ability to create outfits and annotate them within the shopping experience. Employees were able to better convey the choices made to the member in the context of an outfit, and the members were then able to reference those looks down the road.

Related to this area of work is an iOS app a small team and I designed and built from the ground up (our first app in Swift) that allows employees to better manage their members and associated tasks throughout the day / when away from a desk. The app acts as a companion to the desktop software and was designed in the context of being on-the-go. The app gives employees the ability to review relevant member information, create new members, review and complete tasks, review personal goals, and more.

Another iOS app we were able to take from product vision & design all the way through first release was an iPad app created to standardize and better the experience for the custom garment process. This app and the backend service that supported it provided the first real structured data set related to our custom garment business. The app gave employees the ability to store and edit member measurements and create / edit / duplicate orders. Beyond this it provided several auto-calculated and auto-completed values, as well as warnings when values are outside of an expected threshold.

All of these experiences were the product of a team and reflect the state they were at during my active design/development. At Trunk Club we have a very iterative / test driven approach and each of these has been continually developed upon since.
