	<p>I believe that every home needs at least one beautiful accent piece — something that spruces up your whole home and stops your guests in their tracks. With Oakdale Boutique, every piece is custom-made and hand-painted, using solid, antique furniture, because they just don’t make furniture like they used to. Oakdale Boutique is located in the heart of Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood.</p>

	<h3>Looking for something specific?</h3>
	<p>Contact me about a custom order and we can work together to find and restore the custom piece of furniture of your dreams!</p>

	<h3>Shipping</h3>
	<p>Free Chicago-area pickup or $20 delivery (within an hour drive of the city). For shipping outside Chicago area, message me for an estimated quote and we can discuss options. Shipping currently available only in continental U.S.</p> 

	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>All sales are final. I update antique and vintage furniture, so please note that each piece will not be in brand-new condition. Please message with with any questions prior to purchase.</p>
